<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>If you are using the program, you are running the risk of inadvertantly starting a chain of events which might ultimately cause the destruction of our Universe. If any thing like that (or less serious than that) happens, I will not be held responsible.</p>
<p>Hmm... I tried to put up something similar to the legal jargon accompanying most programs... Seems like I exaggerated slightly.</p>
